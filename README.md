# üîÑ BLE Finite State Machine (FSM) ‚Äì Version 1

This project demonstrates a **dynamic role-switching** behavior using the **nRF52833** of Noridc Semiconductor and the **Zephyr RTOS Bluetooth stack**. The device acts as a **Peripheral** initially and switches to **Central** mode based on a GATT command from a connected device (e.g., a smartphone).

---

## üì° Workflow Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial State ‚Äì Peripheral Mode (GATT Server)
- The `nRF52833` starts in **Peripheral** mode.
- It advertises its presence over Bluetooth.
- Awaits a connection from a **Central device** (such as a smartphone).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ GATT Command Trigger
- Once connected, the **Central** device writes a command `"SCAN"` to a predefined **GATT characteristic**.
- The `nRF52833` receives this command and performs the following actions:
  - Stops advertising (disabling Peripheral role).
  - Calls `bt_le_scan_start()` to begin scanning for nearby Bluetooth devices.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Switch to Central Mode
- After transitioning, the `nRF52833` now acts as a **Central** device.
- It scans and lists nearby **Peripheral** devices (e.g., speakers or sensors).

---

## üîß Technical Notes
- GATT service and characteristic UUIDs are defined in the firmware to handle incoming BLE commands.
- BLE stack features like **dual-role (Central + Peripheral)**, **observer mode**, and **GATT write handling** are enabled via `prj.conf`.

---

## üì± Use Case Example
This behavior is ideal for applications where a device:
- Starts in advertising mode to receive control input.
- Then scans for other devices (e.g., to relay commands or collect data).
